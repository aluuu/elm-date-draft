# Pure Elm date and time manipulation library

Purpose is to create library which would not be based on tricky Javascript Date() object and would be pure functional.

This libarary is heavily inspired by Haskell's [time](https://hackage.haskell.org/package/time) library, but trying to avoid its' API complexity.
